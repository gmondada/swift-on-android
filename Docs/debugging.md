This is an exploratory work to experiment with Swift debugging on Android, see what works and what doesn’t, and understand how difficult the available tools are to use. It’s just an initial step toward the ultimate goal, which is to integrate these tools in a way that provides a smooth and intuitive user experience for anyone trying or adopting Swift on Android.
